### What I learned
This time it was an easy challenge, but I can say that it was precisely the first one in which I did not need to check a tutorial to solve it. For the first time I tried the "mobile first" methodology, which I will try to use from now on in future projects. Also for the first time use variables for the CSS. I also learned better how the "display:block" property works to edit some elements such as images and apply a "border-radius" without the need to use "overflow: hidden", which for some reason cut off the bottom part of the image (probably because i don't know how to apply it correctly, but for this case I think that using display: block on the image works perfectly)
